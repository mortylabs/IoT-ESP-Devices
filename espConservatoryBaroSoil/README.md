This is an esp widfi device I havbe in my conservatory.

It measures the air temperature, air pressure, and the soil moisture of an indoor plant.
It then publishes that data to an MQTT broker in a format that Home Assistant and its "auto discovery" feature can use. 

The device has a simple webpage that you can view to see the status of the device and its sensors:

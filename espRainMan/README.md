# Rain Man

Fresh life was breathed into an old 1960s rain indicator belonging to my grandparents, where the lamp contained litmus paper that changed from blue to pink if a storm was approaching.

The defuct litmus paper was replaced with blue / pink led bulbs, and the whole gadet was mounted onto a cheap wooden pencil box that I then varnished. 
The esp and sensors are contained  within the pencil box.

# Rain Man

An old 1960s rain indicator belonging to my grandparents has a new life!

It's a humerous figurene of a drunkard hanging onto a lamp post. The lamp once contained litmus paper that changed from blue to pink if a storm was approaching.

The defuct litmus paper was replaced with blue / pink led bulbs, and the whole gadet was mounted onto a cheap Â£2 wooden pencil box. A screen was mounted into the lid of the pencil box, a motion sensor added to activate the screen when someone enters the room, and the esp and temperature / barometer are of course hidden away within the box.

Source code has only 2 lines which need to be configured:

float LOCALALTUD            = 1469 ;  // local altitude in meters
